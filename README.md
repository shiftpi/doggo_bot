## How to run
If you want to run the bot on your own make sure to register your bot propperly.
Have a look on [https://core.telegram.org/bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
for that. You also need a Pixabay account for grabbing the doggo pictures.

When you have both copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json` and enter your Telegram tokens.

You can now run `node index.js` and have fun with the doggos.
