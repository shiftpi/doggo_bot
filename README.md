## How to run
If you want to run the bot on your own make sure to register your bot properly.
Have a look at [https://core.telegram.org/bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
for that. You also need an Azure account with Cognitive Services enabled.

When you did, copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json` and enter your Telegram token and your Azure region
and API key.

You can now run `node index.js` and have fun with the doggos.
