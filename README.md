## How to run
If you want to run the bot on your own make sure to register your bot properly.
Have a look at [https://core.telegram.org/bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
for that. You also need an Azure account with Cognitive Services enabled and a GIPHY api key.

When you did, copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json` and enter your API tokens and your Azure region.

You can now run `npm i` or `yarn` and `node index.js`. Have fun with the doggos!
